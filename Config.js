    about: `I'm George Lam, a multidisciplinary creator with a passion for building innovative technology products. 
            With a background spanning design, development, and product management, I bring a unique perspective to every project.
            My work is driven by a desire to solve complex problems with elegant solutions. I believe in the power of technology 
            to transform lives and businesses, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.
            When I'm not creating, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
            or mentoring the next generation of tech innovators.`,
